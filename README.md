## About <a name = "about"></a>
- security project includes communication between sender and receiver with RSA encryption algorithm and breaking it with mathematical attack using python socket.
- both sender and receiver can send and receive messages
- I have implemented the RSA encryption algorithm using Python scripts(.py).
- The project is divided into: common functions, chat module using sockets, RSA encryption and decryption, chosen ciphertext attack(mathematical model)

## Installation <a name = "installation"></a>

- pip install sockets

- pip install matplotlib

- pip install sympy
## How to run <a name = "run"></a>
- Any IDE or code editor can be able to run python scripts.
- if you don't have these libraries, install them.
- First, We should run the Sender, then the Receiver.
- Both sender and receiver can send and receive messages, The sender sends to the receiver and vice versa time after time in order.


## To test attacks <a name = "attacks"></a>
- run attacks.py
  - 1 => for mathematical attack
  - 2 => for test Efficiency
  - 
## Screen Vedio <a name = "screen-vedio"></a>
